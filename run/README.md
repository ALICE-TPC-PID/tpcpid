# How to run

To execute the framework please use

```bash
python3 /path/to/framwork/run/run.py --config /path/to/framwork/run/configs/configurations.json
```

Everything is steered through the configuration.json file. This file will get updated during processing and will be stored in the output folder. The name of the output folder will be auto-generated or can be manually created using the key dataset/outputPath (not default, needs to be added manually).
